looking at these and figure out the differences..

by adding "<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.5.6/angular.min.js"></script>" into your html page's
head lets u to include "Angular" features to your page

By including Angular into our html page , we can use pleanty of inbuilt angular tags in our page
Allmost all angular tags starts with "ng-" .
